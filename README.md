# BiscuitCss [Beta v0.1]
Next generation Css Framework. 

â€¢ Is Biscuit for you?

You should use Biscuit if you're embarking on a smaller project or just don't feel like you need all the utility of larger frameworks. Biscuit only styles a handful of standard HTML elements and includes a grid, but that's often more than enough to get started. In fact, this site is built on Biscuit and has ~600 lines of custom CSS (half of which is the docking navigation).
